			<h3>The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world.</h3><h3> Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.</h3>
			<br><h3>The Internet consists of technologies developed by different individuals and organizations.<br> Important figures include Robert W. Taylor, who led the development of the<b><i> ARPANET</i></b> (an early prototype of the Internet),<br> and Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technologies.</h3>
			<h3>The Internet works through a series of networks that connect devices around the world through telephone lines.<br> Users are provided access to the Internet by Internet service providers. The widespread use of mobile broadband and Wi-Fi <br>in the 21st century has allowed this connection to be wireless.
			While the Internet is theoretically decentralized and thus<br> controlled by no single entity, many argue that tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google represent<br> a small concentration of organizations that have unprecedented influence over the information and money on the Internet.<br> In some countries, certain parts of the Internet are blocked via censorship.</h3>
