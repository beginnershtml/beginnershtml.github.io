	<h2>In the beginning, the Web was just text, and it was really quite boring.<br> Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed images <br>(and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. <br>There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with <br>the humble &ltimg&gt element, used to embed a simple image in a webpage.<br> In this article we'll look at how to use it in depth, including the basics, <br>annotating it with captions using, and detailing how it relates to CSS background images.</h2>

	<h2>In order to put a simple image on a webpage, we use the &ltimg&gt element. <br>This is an empty element (meaning that it has no text content or closing tag) <br>that requires a minimum of one attribute to be useful — src (sometimes spoken as its full title, source). <br>The src attribute contains a path pointing to the image you want to embed in the page, which can be a relative or absolute URL.<br>Alt text is mandatory in &ltimg&gt tag.</h2>
	<h2><font style="color:blue">SYNTAX:<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/72Q0ZBp/imgsyntax.jpg" border="2px"><br>The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.</font></h2>
